## FAQ

### What is this?

A random generator, currently primarily for Stars Without Number GMs

### Why?

For fun.

### What's not your content?

Some lists have a base in other people's content (and are credited), however nothing is copied without significant modification/adaption. The exception to this is directly using entries from the Stars Without Number core rulebook, as these are generators specifically for the game.
Some bits of code are AI generated, largely boilerplate.
